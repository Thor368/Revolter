# Revolter 100V
Fork of the original HSWR Version 2 to support up to 100V and two TO-220 MOSFET packages.

#Work in progress

# TODO

## V1.0
- first prerealse at alpha stage
- some bugs but works

## V1.1
- did an great overhaul of high current paths
- fixed wrong 3V3 reg pin out
- blew the IO connector up to 8 pins (turns out 7pin is rare)
- changed shunt to 2512
- changed hf caps to double 1210
- two input caps
- pin outs for all IO on silk screen
- spread the references so you can actually read them
- connected the Hall/Temp pull-ups to 3V3 instead of 5V
