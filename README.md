# Introduction
This is a downsized fork of the original HSWR Version 2. The power stage supports up to two TO-220 MOSFET in parallel. The insulation is desgined for up to 100V. If you are adventurous you could push it with higher voltage MOSFETs and bootstrapping diodes. The layout has two copper layers on a 100x100mmÂ² footprint. All in all this fork represents a cost optimization. PCBs like this can be as low as 2$ per 10 PCBs.

# Status
## 8.11.
At this stage I only got the first batch of PCBs made and deliverd. My choice of switching convers was unfavorable as Diodes and Texas Instruments seem to have supply difficulties. Never the less the first PCB is partially populated and waits for its final parts.

#Work in progress
